"About GMAT Club: Every year, brilliant minds of business school applicants develop strategies, research school information, and master interviews, only for the same process to be repeated the following year by the new applicant pool.  In 2002, GMAT Club was formed to help preserve the collective knowledge of MBA students – to contribute to each other’s learning. Through information sharing and the development of new resources, it is our goal to improve the Business School application process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
